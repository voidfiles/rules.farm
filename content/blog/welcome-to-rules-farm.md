Rules proscribed by Alex Kessinger for Rules: Farm

In order to create a blog about rules. We should probably put some rules in place.

Right now I can only think of one rule. I'll figure the rest of them out over time.

1. Blog posts will collect examples of knowledge encoded in discrete statements.
    
    My goal with this site is to curate a selection of rules, laws, and perscriptions that people have created after building a body of knowledge. Craftsmen at the end of their lifes, knowledge gained after trying to do something hard, etc. 

Check out the [homepage](/) if you want to see some examples.
