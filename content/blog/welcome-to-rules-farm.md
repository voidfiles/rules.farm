author_description: |
    One of the greatest graphic designers of our time, passed away this Friday on his 91st birthday in New York City. Well known for his 1977 “I ❤️ NY” logo and  [his Bob Dylan poster with psychedelic hair](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/8108) , Glaser changed the visual culture in the 1960s and 70s with his brightly colored, expressive designs and “brought wit, whimsy, narrative and skilled drawing to commercial art at a time when advertising was dominated by the severe strictures of modernism”, as William Grimes writes in  [his obituary for the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/obituaries/milton-glaser-dead.html) . Glaser designed over 400 posters in his lifetime, was  [a founder of New York magazine](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/06/milton-glaser-new-york-and-iny-designer-dies-at-91.html) , a strong believer in the power of drawing, and in the obligation to pass on your experience through teaching. In case you want to learn more about him and his work, there is  [a lovely short film by Hillman Curtis](https://vimeo.com/19005726) , the documentary  [“To Inform and Delight”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ1YHqgZzGQ) ,  [his illuminating TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWmJcR-x_hc) , and  [a wonderful interview with Debbie Millman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py2vt4vcMa8).
